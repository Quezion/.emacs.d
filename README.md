# .emacs.d
Clojure focused init.el with good comments

Uses [straight.el](https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el) for deterministic package management. Versions are based off Git project SHAs. To upgrade dependencies, update the version-lock file at straight/versions/default.el

Includes many Clojure tools including CIDER, font-locking, and more.

Relies on Projectile & Helm for project navigation (try `C-c P`) & dynamic autocompleting menus.
